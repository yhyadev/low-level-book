# What is a program?

## Introduction

In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, and may peace and blessings be upon the most honorable of messengers, prophet Muhammad.

We start by asking the question what is a program, and it is an easy question to be answered.

## Programs are Data Transfromers

A program is simple: a data transfromer.

What are the data we are transforming? Anything on a computer is defined as data, what I am typing currently is still data represented as 0s and 1s, what your screen is viewing is still also data represented as 0s and 1s.
Why do we do data transformations? Basically because if you don't transform data then there is not a single reason about computers' existence;
It's in the name, a computer is mainly made because an engineer thought it is great to have an electronic calculator, that calculator evolved into being advanced, by using 1s and 0s to represent data and letting a program transform these data to something you can as a human understand.

## Hardware is the destination

We are simply making a Math Function for a Hardware that can solve this Math Function for given arguments.
We are not making a new Hardware in our code to work on an existing Hardware, There is already existing Hardware that solves all of our problems using (math, electrons, circuits, input/output devices) that works using real world power.

## Status Quo

The problem we are facing currently is that we stopped asking about why our code works and how is it being executed by the Hardware, as it is not required by modern tech companies and the market is in decline of people that actually are programmers that know how they program and not how they replicate other programs in a programming language and gets hyped up just for a new programming language that "Wow, it stops me from writing bad code" which is exactly why I made this book, to remember the reason computers are made for.

## Conclusion

Praise be to God, Lord of the whole World, and with this we end the page. I will see you on the next page if God wills.
